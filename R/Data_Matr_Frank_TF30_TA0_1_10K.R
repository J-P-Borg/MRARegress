#' A matrix with 30 rows and 30 columns : Connectivity Matrix got from FRANK (TF=300, TA=0, file 1, 10% noise).
#' Here, we have a priori knowledge : about 10% of the edges are known (ie : node j amplifies or inhibits the expression of node i, 
#' or nodes i and j don't interact). This knowledge is used by MRARegress, by introduction of convexity constraints with the Least Square optimization problem.
#' See the article "Modular response analysis reformulated as a multilinear regression problem" (Borg et al, 2023).
