#' @format ## `Knlg_10`
#' A matrix with 30 rows and 30 columns : A priori knowledge concerning the Connectivity Matrix got from FRANK (TF=300, TA=0, file 1, 10% noise).
#' Here, we have a priori knowledge : about 10% of the edges are known (ie : node j amplifies or inhibits the expression of node i, 
#' or nodes i and j don't interact). This knowledge is used by MRARegress, by introduction of convexity constraints with the Least Square optimization problem.
#'		Knlg_10\[i,j\] = "x"		: no a priori knowledge about this edge
#'		Knlg_10\[i,j\] = "-1"		: node j inhibits the expression of node i
#'		Knlg_10\[i,j\] = "0"		: nodes i and j don't interact
#'		Knlg_10\[i,j\] = "1"		: node j amplifies the expression of node i
