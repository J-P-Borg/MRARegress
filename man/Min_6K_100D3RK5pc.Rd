A matrix with 6 rows and 6 columns : the min of the "95\% Confidence Intervals" of the "Exact Connectivity Matrix".
Six nodes network "Kinases MKK, MKKK et MAPK + bi-phosphorylated forms", described in the articles "Inferring dynamic architecture of cellular
networks using time series of gene expression, protein and metabolite data" Eduardo Sontag et al, 2004 and "Untangling the wires:
A strategy to trace functional interactions in signaling and gene networks" Boris N. Kholodenko et al, PNAS 2002
Solution_6K[i,j] = the exact coefficient ri,j.

These Confidence intervals are obtained by making 100 random draws (100D in the name), adding gaussian independant variables N(0, sd) to the expression matrix values
