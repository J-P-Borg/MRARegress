\subsection{\code{MatExp2}}{

A matrix with 10 rows and 21 columns (the "Expression Matrix"):
MatExp[i,1..nbBase] represents the measurement of node i when no perturbation is applied to the network (here, nbBase = 1),
MatExp[i,j], j>nbBase,  represents the measurement of node i when perturbation j-nbBase is applied to the network.
As we have two sets of perturbation ("KO" and "KD"), we have twice as many columns (plus one: nbBase = 1) than rows.
